#Arduino based ATEM kill switch using Uno + Ethernet

This is for having an emergency kill switch for an ATEM that will dump
both the program and preview source to a pre-defined source if the button
is hit.  The reason it sets both program and preview is so that there 
needs to be manual intervention to bring the feed back online.
